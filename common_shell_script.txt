ls -l:

lists all the files in current working directory in long listing format.
 for example:

#!/bin/bash
# A simple bash script to move up to desired directory level directly

function jump()
{
 	#Original value of Internal Field separator
	OLDIFS=$IFS

	#Setting field separator to "/"
	IFS=/

	#converting working path into array of directories in path
	#eg. /my/path/is/like/this

	#into [,my,path,is,like,this]
	path_arr=($PWD)
	
	#setting IFS to original value
	IFS=$OLDIFS
	
	local pos=-1

	# ${path_arr[@]} gives all the values in the path_arr
for dir in "${path_arr[@]}"
do
pos=$[$pos+1]
if [ "$1" = "$dir" ];then
cwd=$pwd
limit=$[$dir_in_path-$pos-1]
for ((i=0;i<limit;i++))
do
	cwd=$cwd/..
	done
	cd $cwd
	break
fi
done
}
 giving permission for making the shell script executable :
$ chmod -x path/to/our/file/file_name.sh
to make this available on every terminal session we have to put this in ".bashrc" file.
".bashrc" is a shell script that bash shell runs whenever it is started interactively

It is the purpose of a .bashrc file is to provide a place where you can set up variables,functions and aliases

$echo "source ~/path/to/our/file/jump.sh">> ~/.bashrc

$jump dir_name 

Example-2:

#!/bin/bash
#reading data from the user:
read -p 'Enter a : ' a
	read
-p 'Enter b : ' b

add=$((a + b))
echo Addition of a and b are $add

subtract=$((a - b))
echo subtraction of a and b are $subtract

multiply=$((a * b))
echo multiplication of a and b are $div
